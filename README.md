Viscosity Sensor with Zynq7000, Slice IP, XADC IP, Concat IP, and DSP RTL

#This project is the main submission for assignment number - 2.




#Additionally (outside to the scope of this assignment),

Refer to the repo given below for the bigger project with customIP accelerator for torq calculation, BRAM controller, DMA, FIFO etc. NOTE- the below project with accelerator could not be completed due to high complexity thus the above one which is submitted is used for assignment.
